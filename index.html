      <ul>
        <li>
          After coming this far you might be knowing my name but let me again
          introduce myself formally. My name is Anuj Kirodia and I am from
          Jaipur, Rajasthan. The journey to this institute has been through many
          hardships and still many are there on their way.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are
          many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.I like to think, I
          like to dream, I like to talk, I like to listen. One’s future can be
          determined by what one has achieved today or what one is doing today.
        </li>
        <li>
          A man who dreams only for future and does nothing for tomorrow can be
          best named as lazy and pathetic. In that way, I dislike myself being
          called as a man without a vision and castle maker in sky.Therefore,
          writing about myself, I am here to express myself that what I see,
          what I experience and what I plan for my life is the total
          manifestation of what I do today. I try myself to be humble,
          passionate, dedicated and hardworking.
        </li>
        <li>
          I deem my parents as being my best mentors. I have learnt the real
          meaning and worth of life from my parents. I am with a happy, focused
          and hardworking family. That is definitely the greatest blessing of
          God for me.
